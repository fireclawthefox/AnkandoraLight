# Ankandora
An adventure board game for 1-4 players.

This implementation is the light/travel version that was dedicated for ease of use, shorter play times and quicker learning curve.

The game can be played alone in singleplayer mode or by creating a server and opening rooms for others to join. As it is currently WIP there are a lot of features missing and remaining issues.

Current features:
- Singleplayer mode
- Dedicated server
- 2 (out of 4) types of pieces with dedicated stats
- Basic game features (moving on the board, fighting)
- 2 different game modes
